Use the arrow keys or WASD to move the player and use the numbers 1 and 2 to switch weapons. 

The gravity gun is the default gun and is used to moving objects which are tagged debris and the second gun is the blowtorch which is used by pressing right click on the mouse, which locks the objects in place and untags it so it cannot be picked up again.
The timer should last for at least 4 minutes and will respawn the player to the beginning when it runs out.

Enter the room on the right hand side at the end of the corridor, put all the objects where the blue squares are which meet the shape of the object, the blue squares do not do anything and are just there to help the player know where to place the object.

After that go back into the corridor and turn right to walk to the end of the corridor, and then hit space bar to jump to second floor, this is simply to show you how the player will jump between different floors and nothing is there since all the mechanics will be used in the first floor.
